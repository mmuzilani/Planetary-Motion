Kepler's Laws Visualization in Python

This Python program demonstrates Kepler’s First and Second Laws of planetary motion using simple geometric visualization.

Kepler’s First Law: Planet moves in an ellipse with the star at one focus.

Kepler’s Second Law: The planet moves faster when it is near the star and slower when it is farther away.
Features

First Law Visualization

Draws an elliptical orbit.

The star is positioned at one focus.

Inputs:

Semi-major axis a

Semi-minor axis b

Star position along x-axis (focus)

Second Law Visualization

Shows speed variation along the orbit using a color map.

Simulates the planet moving faster near the star and slower when farther away.

Same input parameters as above.

Notes

This is a visual demonstration only.

You can experiment with different values of a, b, and star position to see various elliptical shapes.

The second law uses a simple approximation to show speed variation; it is not a precise physical simulation.
