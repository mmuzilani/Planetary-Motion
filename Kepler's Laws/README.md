# Kepler's Laws Visualization in Python

This Python program demonstrates **Kepler’s First and Second Laws** of planetary motion using simple geometric visualization.

- **First Law:** Planet moves in an **ellipse** with the star at one focus.  
- **Second Law:** Planet moves **faster when closer to the star** and slower when farther away.

## Features

1. **First Law Visualization**
   - Draws an **elliptical orbit**.
   - Star positioned at one focus.
   - User inputs: semi-major axis `a`, semi-minor axis `b`, star position (focus).

2. **Second Law Visualization**
   - Shows **speed variation** along the orbit using a color map.
   - Same inputs as above.

3.  The program generates two plots:

Elliptical orbit (First Law)

Orbit with speed variation (Second Law)

Notes:

This is a visual demonstration, not a precise physics simulation.

Experiment with different a, b, and star positions to see different elliptical orbits.

Speed variation is approximated to illustrate Kepler’s Second Law visually.
